main difference in how they handle asynchronous functions

PROMISES:
 using Methods
    .then (handles successes, handles erroes); .catch (error handling) ; .finally (passes through - used for cleanup check)

ASYNC/await
 write asynchronous code that looks & behaves more like synchronus code 
 *more readable 
 using Blocks
    .try & .catch --> for error handling
ASYNC function always returns a Promise 
    (async (ES2017(ES8)) was built ontop of promises (introduced ES62015))
