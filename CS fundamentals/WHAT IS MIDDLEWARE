What is Middleware? 

It is those methods/functions/operations that are called BETWEEN processing the Request and sending the Response in your application method.

you NEED express.json() and express.urlencoded() for POST and PUT requests 
    because in both these requests you are sending data to the server that you are asking server to accept or store that data 

    express.json() --> method built into express to recognize incoming request obejct as JSON object 
        -- app.use(express.json());

    express.urlencoded() --> metod built into express to recognize incoming request object as strings or arrays 
        -- app.use(express.urlencoded());


serve static files - images - css files - js files -- use express.static 
 function signature is : 
    -- express.static(root, [options])
